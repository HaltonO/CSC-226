## Weighted Quick Union --- Continued

### Union

__Proposition__, The depth of any node is $\le \lg N$.

__Proof:__

The depth goes up (by 1) only on a union with $x$ where $x$ is in the smaller tree,

* the size of the tree containing $x$ is at least twice as large on such a union
* the size of a tree can double at most $\lg N$ times


Using __rank__ instead of node count to track the size of the trees can reduce the space complexity since the maximum bit length for the rank is $\le \lg(\lg(N))$

### Compression

We make nodes along the find path point to the root.

To do this __with two passes__ we can perform a second loop setting every node to the root.

To do this __with one path__ this make every other node in the path point to it's grandparent.

```c
public int find(int i){   while (i != id[i])   {      id[i] = id[id[i]]; //<-- Set the Grandparent      i = id[i]; 
   }   return i;
}
```

## Comparison Based Sorting

In __Comparison Based Sorting__ like,

* Mergesort
* Quicksort
* Heapsort

Let's say we are sorting something `sort([a,b,c])`,

![Example Sorting Tree](img/Sorting-Tree.png)

This comparison tree has 6 leaves. In general it has to be $\ge N!$ (because that's how many possible combinations there are).

The height is the worst case number of comparisons, in this case 3. What is the minimum height $h$ of an extended binary tree with $n$ leaves?

$$\begin{align}
    n &\le 2^h \newline
    \lceil \lg n \rceil &\le h
\end{align}$$


Therefore the height for sorting is $\ge \lceil \lg{N!} \rceil$. We can bound $N!$ with,

$$\begin{align}
    \left( \frac{n}{2} \right) ^ \frac{n}{2} \le N! \le N^N
\end{align}$$

 and by taking the log,

$$\begin{align}
    \frac{n}{2} \lg \left( \frac{n}{2} \right) \le \lg{N!} \le N \lg {N}
\end{align}$$

So comparison based sorting requires $\Omega (N \lg N)$ comparisons.
