## Undirected Graphs

We can consider a graph,


$$\begin{align}
    G = (V,E)
\end{align}$$

### Bipartite Graph

_definition_: A graph is __bipartite__ is there is a partition $A,B$ of $V$ such that all edges $(a,b) \in E$ have $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

Trees are an example of a bipartite set, we can show this using a __two coloring__. So are paths, even cycles, and complete bipartite graphs.

### Subgraphs

_definition_: A graph $G^\prime$ is a __subgraph__ of a graph $G$ if $V^\prime \subseteq V$, $E^\prime \subseteq E$ and all edges in $E^\prime$ are valid.

There are a few special types of subgraphs,

* __spanning__: Uses all the vertices in $G$, i.e., $V^\prime = V$
* __induced__: Uses all the valid edges in $G$ (with the selected vertices)
