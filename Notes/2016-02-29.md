    - see [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg)
- Hamilton Cycle - Contains every vertex once

## Some Theorums

- A undirected graph has a Eulerian cycle iff every vertex has even degree
- A directed graph has a Eulerian Path iff exactly 2 vertices have odd degrees
