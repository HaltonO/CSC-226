### Max

__Theorem__: $n - 1$ is the best upper bound for finding the maximum in an unordered array.

__Proof__: Make a graph $G = (V,E)$,

$$
    V = \text{ vertices } = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \}
$$

Each time a comparison is made say $a_i \lt a_j$ add the edge $(i,j)$. If the algorithm is correct, then at the end $G$ must be connected. For $G$ to be connected it must have at least $\left|E\right| \ge n - 1$ edges.

### Merge

__Theorem__: $2n - 1$ is the best upper bound for the merge operation.

__Proof__: Suppose the input is ordered so that,

$$
    a_1 \lt b_1 \lt \underbrace{a_2 \lt b_2}_\text{not made} \lt ... \lt a_n \lt b_n
$$

If some comparison, either $a_i \lt b_i$ or $b_i \lt a_{i+1}$ is not made, then the algorithm will fail. This is called an _adversarial argument_.
