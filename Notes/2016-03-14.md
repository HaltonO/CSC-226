## Shortest Path Algorithms Continued

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

_definition_: To find the shortest path between all pairs `d[n][n]` and make a shortest distance matrix. Let $d_{ij}^{(k)}$ be the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ passing through vertices, $1,2,...,k$. The algorithm states,

$$\begin{aligned}
    d_{ij}^{(k)} = \min(d_{ij}^{(k-1)},d_{ik}^{(k-1)} + d_{kj}^{(k-1)})
\end{aligned}$$
