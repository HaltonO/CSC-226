## Max Flow & Mincut

### Mincut

_definition_: Given an edge weighted digraph with source $s$ and sink $t$, we define,

* **$st$-cut** is a partition of two disjoint sets, with $s$ in one set $A$ and $t$ in the other set $B$.
* **Capacity** is the sum of the capacities of the edges from $A$ to $B$.

The problem is to find a cut of minimum capacity.

### Max Flow

_definition_: Given an edge weighted digraph with source $s$ and sink $t$, an **$st$-flow** is an assignment of values to the edge such that,

* **Capacity**, $0 \le \text{edge's flow} \le \text{edge's capacity}$
* **Equilibrium**, The inflow equals the outflow at every vertex except $s$ and $t$.

The **value** of a flow is the total inflow at $t$. The problem is to find the maximum value.
