## Hashing

_definition_: With __hashing__ we save items in a key-indexed table (where the index is a function of the key). A **hash function** is used for computing the array index from the key.

### Horner's Rule

To hash a string we use,


$$\begin{align}
    h = s[0] \cdot 31^{L–1} + \ldots + s[L – 3] \cdot 31^2 + s[L – 2] \cdot 31^1 + s[L – 1] \cdot 31^0
\end{align}$$

for example,

```java
public final class String
{
    private final char[] s;
    ...
    public int hashCode()
    {
        int hash = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < length(); i++)
            hash = s[i] + (31 * hash);
        return hash;
    }
} 
```

## Probability

How many people does it take before the probability that two have the same birthday is more than 50%?

Let's assume that all birthdays are equally likely, what's the probability that $n$ people have different birthdays?

So,


$$\begin{align}
    p &= \frac{\text{favourable cases}}{\text{total number of cases}} \\\\
    &= \frac{\binom{365}{n}n!}{365^n}
\end{align}$$

we could also think of this as,


$$\begin{align}
    \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdot \frac{363}{365} \cdot \ldots \cdot\frac{365-n}{365}
\end{align}$$

let's rewrite this where $D$ is the days,


$$\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{0}{D}\right)\left( 1 - \frac{2}{D}\right)\ldots\left( 1 - \frac{n-1}{D}\right)
\end{align}$$
