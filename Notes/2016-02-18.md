## Minimum Weight Spanning Trees Continued

### Prim's Algorithm

* __Lazy__: Keep track of edges in cut
* __Eager__: Keep track of vertices not in tree

## Indexed Priority Queues

For the __eager__ algorithm, we implement it with a binary queue. We maintain the arrays,

* `keys[i]` is th priority of `i`
* `pq[i]` is the index of the key in heap position `i`
* `qp[i]` is the heap position of the key with index `i`
