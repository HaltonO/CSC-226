## Random Permutations

_How do we generate a random permutation?_

We would like it to be uniform with an equal probability of $\frac{1}{n!}$ for each permutation.

```py
a = [0,1,2,...,n]
for i = n-1, i > 0, --i
    t = a[i]
    j = rand(0,i-1)
    a[i] = a[j]
    a[j] = t
```

we swap elements on one of the remaining elements in the list, e.g.

```
a = [1,2,3,4,5]

  = [5,2,3,4,1]
     *       ^
  = [5,2,4,3,1]
         * ^
  = [4,2,5,3,1]
     *   ^
  = [2,4,5,3,1]
     * ^
```

we can see this is uniform 


$$\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot  \frac{1}{1} =  \frac{1}{5!}
\end{align}$$
