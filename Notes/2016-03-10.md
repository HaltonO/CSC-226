## Shortest Path Algorithms

_definition_: Given a directed edge-weighted graph, find the __shortest path__ from $s$ to $w$.

We begin by setting the distance to $s$ to $0$ and the distance to $w$ to $\infty$ for all other vertices $v$. We  __relax__ an when we evaluate the actual shortest path from that node to $w$.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

_definition_: To find the shortest path between $a$ and $b$. Pick the unvisited vertex with the lowest distance and calculate the distance through it to each unvisited neighbour, then update the neighbour's distance if smaller. Mark the vertex visited (or red) when done with neighbours.

#### Directed Acyclic Graph

On a directed acyclic graph the algorithm takes $O(E+V)$.
